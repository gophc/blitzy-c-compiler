//! # IR Instruction Definitions
//!
//! This module defines all intermediate representation (IR) instruction types
//! for BCC.  Instructions are the fundamental building blocks of the IR —
//! every pipeline phase from AST-to-IR lowering (Phase 6) through optimization
//! passes (Phase 8) to code generation (Phase 10) operates on them.
//!
//! ## SSA Value Numbering
//!
//! Each instruction that produces a result carries a unique [`Value`] (an SSA
//! virtual register number).  Values are numbered sequentially per function
//! and are immutable once assigned — this is the core SSA property.
//!
//! ## Terminator Instructions
//!
//! [`Branch`](Instruction::Branch), [`CondBranch`](Instruction::CondBranch),
//! [`Switch`](Instruction::Switch), and [`Return`](Instruction::Return) are
//! *terminator* instructions that end their containing basic block.  Every
//! well-formed basic block has exactly one terminator as its last instruction.
//!
//! ## Phi Nodes
//!
//! [`Phi`](Instruction::Phi) instructions implement SSA merge semantics at
//! control-flow join points.  Each phi carries a list of `(Value, BlockId)`
//! pairs — one per incoming control-flow edge — selecting the appropriate
//! reaching definition at runtime.  Phi nodes always appear at the beginning
//! of a basic block, before any non-phi instructions.
//!
//! ## Alloca-Then-Promote Pattern
//!
//! The IR lowering phase (Phase 6) emits [`Alloca`](Instruction::Alloca)
//! instructions for every local variable in the entry basic block.  The
//! subsequent mem2reg pass (Phase 7) promotes eligible allocas to SSA
//! virtual registers, inserting phi nodes at dominance frontiers.  This
//! mirrors the LLVM approach to SSA construction.
//!
//! ## Instruction Categories
//!
//! | Category     | Variants                                                  |
//! |-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
//! | Memory       | `Alloca`, `Load`, `Store`                                 |
//! | Arithmetic   | `BinOp`                                                   |
//! | Comparison   | `ICmp`, `FCmp`                                            |
//! | Control flow | `Branch`, `CondBranch`, `Switch`, `Return`                |
//! | Call         | `Call`                                                    |
//! | SSA          | `Phi`                                                     |
//! | Pointer      | `GetElementPtr`                                           |
//! | Casts        | `BitCast`, `Trunc`, `ZExt`, `SExt`, `IntToPtr`, `PtrToInt`|
//! | Inline asm   | `InlineAsm`                                               |
//!
//! ## Zero-Dependency
//!
//! This module depends only on `std` (formatting traits) and internal crate
//! modules — no external crates are used.
