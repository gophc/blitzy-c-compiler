//! # Basic Block Representation
//!
//! This module defines the [`BasicBlock`] type — the fundamental building block
//! of BCC's control flow graph (CFG).
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! A basic block is a straight-line sequence of IR instructions with exactly:
//! - **One entry point** — control flow enters only at the top of the block.
//! - **One exit point** — a *terminator* instruction (Branch, CondBranch,
//!   Switch, or Return) at the bottom that transfers control elsewhere.
//!
//! ## Control Flow Graph
//!
//! Basic blocks are the nodes of the CFG.  Each block maintains lists of
//! predecessor and successor block indices that represent the directed edges
//! of the graph.  These edges are critical for:
//! - **Dominance analysis** — the Lengauer-Tarjan algorithm traverses the CFG
//!   to compute the dominator tree, stored in the [`idom`](BasicBlock::idom)
//!   field.
//! - **SSA construction** — the mem2reg pass uses dominance frontiers (stored
//!   in [`dominance_frontier`](BasicBlock::dominance_frontier)) to determine
//!   where phi nodes must be placed.
//!
//! ## Phi Node Convention
//!
//! Phi instructions (`Instruction::Phi`) must always appear at the **beginning**
//! of a basic block, before any non-phi instructions.  The [`add_phi`](BasicBlock::add_phi)
//! method enforces this by inserting phi nodes after existing phi nodes but
//! before the first non-phi instruction.  The [`phi_instructions`](BasicBlock::phi_instructions)
//! method provides an iterator over exactly the leading phi nodes.
//!
//! ## Block Identification
//!
//! Blocks are identified by their index within the parent function's block list.
//! The [`index`](BasicBlock::index) field stores this position and is set when
//! the block is added to a function.  An optional [`label`](BasicBlock::label)
//! provides human-readable names for IR dumps (e.g., `"entry"`, `"if.then"`,
//! `"loop.header"`).
//!
//! ## Zero-Dependency
//!
//! This module depends only on `crate::ir::instructions::Instruction` and the
//! Rust standard library — no external crates are used.

/// A basic block in the control flow graph (CFG).
///
/// Contains an ordered sequence of [`Instruction`]s terminated by exactly one

///
/// # Invariants
///
/// - The last instruction (if the block is complete) **must** be a terminator.
/// - Non-terminator instructions **must not** appear after the terminator.
/// - Phi nodes **must** appear at the beginning of the block, before any
///   non-phi instruction.
/// - Predecessor and successor lists contain no duplicate entries.
